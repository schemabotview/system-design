// The render engine is the @graphlearning/flow package, not a local folder. `dedupe` is what keeps
// a single copy of react / react-dom / @xyflow/react across this app and the package — the gotcha
// that bites when two React copies meet (invalid-hook-call). The package declares them as peer deps
// and externalises them, so it never carries its own React; dedupe is the belt to that braces.
// jsx is automatic by default with @vitejs/plugin-react.
//
// `base` is `/system-design/` for the production BUILD only (the app deploys under graphl.in/system-design/ as a
// concept app in the GraphL catalog — matching the repo name schemabotview/system-design — so built asset
// URLs must be subpath-relative). Dev/serve stays at `/` so `npm run dev` and the capture/record
// scripts (which drive the dev server at localhost:5173/#/<id>) are unaffected.
